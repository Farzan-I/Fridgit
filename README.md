## How to run locally

## Card wall
We used a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/b9m4qtRa/brainsonbrioche) board to keep track of the features we want to implement. We organised tickets amongst the team and moved the tickets accordingly to demonstrate at what stage that feature's at (To do/In progress/In review etc.).

## Team approach
* Standups every morning at 10:00
* Retro at 5:30 every evening
* Pair programming throughout the whole project
* Regular check-ins with team members to make sure nobody was left behind
* Trello board for distributing work and staying on track

## User stories
```
As a user,
So that I can create a meal from the items in my fridge,
I would like to be able to search for recipes by typing in my ingredients to a search bar.
```
```
As a user, 
So that I can make a complete meal, 
I want to see recipes which only contain the ingredients I have entered.
```
